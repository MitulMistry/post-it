# Post-It
Post-It is a simple note taking application built using a jQuery front end and a Rails back end. The front end leverages AJAX to handle user requests spontaneously, communicating to a serialized JSON back end.

To get the application running, just install dependencies from the gemfile and run migrations. You can seed the database from the seeds file to get some sample data.
